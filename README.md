## Description
You will implement a coin toss game where two computer players each repeatedly toss a coin and try to match a human's call. The result - head or tail - of each toss is randomly generated by your program. In each try, first the human user “calls out” head or tail, then the coins are tossed. A computer player wins a try if its coin matches the call. 
There are four tries in each round. After each round, your program provides feedback about which player won the whole round of four tries. Finally, your program asks the user if they want to play another round.
